# GParse
This project focuses on designing and simulating a hardware module that parses GPS NMEA sentence data received via UART interface, targeting integration with commercial GPS receivers such as the NEO-7M. The design also facilitates transmitting the processed GPS data over UART or further communication interfaces.
